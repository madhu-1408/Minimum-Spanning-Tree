# Minimum-Spanning-Tree

About Source Code:
1. There are 2 Source codes, Sample datasets, a readme file in this submission.
2. We can run the files in any order.
3. To run the prims algorithm, open prims.py file to get the Minimum Spanning Tree using Prims algorithm.
4. To run the kruskals algorithm, open kruskals.py file to get the Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskals algorithm.

About Dataset:
1. First line in the dataset file have the total number of vertices in the graph.
2. From the second line, first and second columns indicate the vertices that are connected to form an edge.
3. Third column indicates the weight of that respective edge.
